    1. `registration.entries.read` for unlimited access

    2. `registration_entries.intermediary.<country>` for intermediary-only access. In this case the field `intermediary` must be set to a permitted value, and only registration entries with a permitted value can be accessed.


    Searchable properties: `internalNotes`


    Filterable properties: `id`, `year`, `intermediary`, `status`, `newCodeholderId`, `timeSubmitted`, `timeStatus`, `currency`


    Special logic operators:

    - `$codeholderData`: Takes an integer to search for a codeholder id, or an object to filter by the following properties, either in `codeholderData` or in an existing codeholder.
      May use the following properties: `address.country`, `feeCountry`, `email`, `birthdate`
