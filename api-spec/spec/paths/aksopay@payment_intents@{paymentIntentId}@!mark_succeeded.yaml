  summary: Sets the status of an AKSOPay PaymentIntent to `succeeded`

    Requires permission: `pay.payment_intents.mark_succeeded.<org>`


    This only works for PaymentIntents using a PaymentMethod of type `manual` or `intermediary`.


    This can only be done when the current status is `submitted`, `disputed` or `pending`.
