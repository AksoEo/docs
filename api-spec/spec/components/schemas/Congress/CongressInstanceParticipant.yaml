          - `null` if price calculation is disabled for the registration form.

          - `true` if `amountPaid` is greater than or equal to either `price` or the registration form's `price.minUpfront`.

          - otherwise `false`

      isValid:
        readOnly: true
        type: boolean

         If `manualApproval` is `true` in the congress registration form, this is the value of `approved`.


         Otherwise, this is `approved || hasPaidMinimum`.

                A custom form var for this participant.


                The type of this property depends on the type of the custom form var as defined in the registration form. `string` is used for all types except e.g. `boolean` for `type=boolean`, `number` for `type=number` etc.
