      Too many ballots are empty (after excluding candidates with too few mentions), and the vote cannot continue.


      For ranked pairs, this means that the majority of all ballots (≥ 50 %) mentioned fewer than two candidates that weren’t excluded, i.e. they contained no candidate pair.


      For other vote types, this means that all ballots were rendered empty due to the mention threshold.
