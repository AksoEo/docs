      How payments made using this PaymentMethod should be treated.

      - `manual` payments require intervention by an authorized user in the form of approving/denying payments based on external sources.

      - `stripe` payments integrate with the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) API and are fully automated.

      - `intermediary` payments are used by intermediaries and must be manually approved like type `manual`.
