# Getting started
First you'll need to determine which authentication method you'll be using. User authentication is only available on certain origins due to the CORS headers. For this reason, you'll likely want to obtain an API key. To do so, please send an email to `admin@akso.org` with information on you or your organization, why you need access to the API and to which resources.

Please note that several API resources do not require any authentication and can be freely requested by anyone.

The base endpoint to the API is `https://api.akso.org/v1/`. Any requests made over HTTP will be denied.
