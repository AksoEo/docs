# Application-specific terminology
AKSO uses English for all source code, databases, technical documentation etc., and Esperanto in everything facing the end user. For this reason it's highly important to use consistent terminology when translating.

This page serves as an Esperanto-English dictionary for terms used within the AKSO codebase.
