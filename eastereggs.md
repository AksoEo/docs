# List of easter eggs in the AKSO admin FE
Most of these are for testing FE features, use at your own discretion.

- pressing <kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↑</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>↓</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>←</kbd><kbd>→</kbd><kbd>b</kbd><kbd>a</kbd> in the login dialog (e.g. inside the username field) will make a ⌘ symbol appear in the top left corner and allow users without the `admin` permission to open the admin FE (pressing the sequence of keys again will turn it back)
- repeatedly clicking the AKSO logo in the sidebar quickly enough will eventually trigger an animation that exposes frontend internals to the browser developer tools
